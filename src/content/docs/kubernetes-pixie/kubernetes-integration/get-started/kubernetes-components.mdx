After deploying Kubernetes you have a cluster, which consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node. Kubernetes runs your workload by placing containers into pods to run on nodes.

The control plane is the container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of containers. The control plane manages also the worker nodes and the pods in the cluster.

There're four distinct components that need to be monitored in a Kubernetes environment each with their specificities and challenges:

* Infrastructure
* Containers
* Applications
* Kubernetes clusters

The Kubernetes integration of New Relic gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. It gives you visibility about Kubernetes namespaces, deployments, replica sets, nodes, pods, and containers. Metrics are collected from different sources:

* `kube-state-metrics service` provides information about state of Kubernetes objects like namespace, replicaset, deployments, and pods (when they are not in running state).
* `/stats/summary` kubelet endpoint gives information about network, errors, memory and CPU usage.
* `/pods` kubelet endpoint provides information about state of running pods and containers.
* `/metrics/cadvisor` cAdvisor endpoint provides missing data that is not included in the previous sources.
* `/metrics` from control plane components: ETCD,controllerManager, apiServer and scheduler.
